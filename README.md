# NYC Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview

This project takes millions of bike ride data points observed during the month of August in NYC, and performs
an analysis for anyone looking to start their own bikesharing business in another location.

## Results

The results of my analysis are published in a Tableau Story:

## Summary

**There are several key takeaways from these visualizations:**

1. Most trips are taken by subscribers.
	* This is especially prevelant in the fact that peak trip times are during rush hours (8am - 9am and 5pm - 7pm).
	* Weekdends to not see these specific peak times for the same reason.
2. Most trips are taken by men.
	* Each visualization is paired with a duplicate, but filtered by gender. Females and Unkown gender do not give very viable information.
3. Trips are taken more heavily in the Manhattan area:
	* The heart of the city is the most densely populated, and it is more likely that residents will need to use alternative modes
	of transportation in order to avoid busy commute routes. 
	* Alternatively, as we go out farther from Manhattan, bus and train travel are more popular as opposed to bikes.

**Two additional visualizations that could be performed are:**

1. A visualization focusing on the most popular stations and looking at their distributions of user type. Are these mostly tourists?

2. While this would require some extra data, such as user ID or something similar, I think it would be extremely helpful to perform
some type of analysis on just the subsriber population. How often do certain subsribers ride, and where do they ride?
